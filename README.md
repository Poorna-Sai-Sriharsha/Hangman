## 🎮 Hangman Game 
Developed Hangman, an interactive word-guessing game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Engineered a responsive interface optimized for desktop and mobile, implementing dynamic word selection across difficulty levels, timer, and score tracking. Utilized CSS animations, grid layouts, and media queries for a seamless UI, demonstrating strong front-end development, game logic, and responsive design skills.

## 🧠 How It Works

- Gameplay: Players guess letters via an on-screen keyboard or physical keyboard input. Correct guesses reveal letters; incorrect guesses advance the hangman image (up to 6 wrong guesses).
- Timer: 60-second countdown per game, ending in a loss if time runs out.
- Scoring: Awards one point per win, displayed on the UI.
- Responsive UI: Adapts to various screen sizes with CSS media queries and a flexible grid-based keyboard.
= Error Handling: Prevents invalid inputs and disables used letters.
